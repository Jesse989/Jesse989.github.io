This is the story of how I went from being a music teacher to being a computer programmer.

I have known for a very long time that I like computers.
I even spent a large amount of my childhood waiting for my turn on our home computer.
I was lucky that my parents thought it important to have a computer in our home, and they brought the first one home when I was still only 5 years old.
