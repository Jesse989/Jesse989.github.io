First, a little bit about me.
I am currently working through the final week of the Flatiron Schools Immersive Data Science program, the final step being an all inclusive capstone project.
The entire course is extremely extensive, and attempts to cram two years of graduate school into just five months of intense courses.
The capstone is designed to showcase my freshly acquired data scientist toolkit, and has to be created from the ground up. No pre-made datasets from Kaggle allowed.
While working on the final project I was offered a full time position as web developer AND data scientist, which had been my dream job from the beginning.
From my vantage point at the end, and with the entire experience relatively fresh in my mind, I thought it would be a great time to share my experience with others.
Iâ€™m going to share some of the concepts I used during this time that helped me stay ahead of the curve and get a job offer two weeks before the end of the course.
