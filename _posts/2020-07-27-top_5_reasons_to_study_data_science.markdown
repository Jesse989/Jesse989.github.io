Earlier this year I made the big decision to attend a programming bootcamp.
I had just completed the online web-development bootcamp by freecodecamp.org (by far the best online web development course I had the fortune of discovering), and was now looking for a surefire way to land a job at a tech company.
I figured attending a paid bootcamp that guaranteed employment would be quick and fairly easy, given my recent completion of a similar program. Most importantly though, at the end I would be given an amazing job as a web developer.
I finally decided against that idea though, if I’m going to be spending money on education, I want to be learning something new that would normally be very difficult to teach myself.
I wanted something exciting, interesting, and valuable. Something that would provide immense value, while complementing my web-developer skillset.
It was at this point I started looking into the data-science track offered at the Flatiron School. I had heard a lot about data-science, though like most people, I lacked a clear understanding of what data science entailed.
I already knew I loved the idea of using technology to create solutions to complex problems, and from what little I had heard from others, that’s exactly what data-science was doing.
I started researching a little bit and this is what I discovered.
