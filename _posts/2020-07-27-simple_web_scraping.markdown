One of my favorite things about data science is that there is so much information out there available on the internet, and once you know how to scrape it, you have unlimited possibilities for creating and answering many different questions!
Web-scraping can be very simple when the information you want comes from a static site, however you begin to run into problems when dealing with dynamic sites that involve multiple HTTP calls during the page loading process.
While there are ways to deal with these trickier sites, such as using an automated browser driver like ‘Selenium’, in this example we will deal with a basic site that has no authentication or additional HTTP calls.
