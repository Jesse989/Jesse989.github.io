**About**

In this article, I’ll attempt to demonstrate how you can set up a quick Flask API to serve your ML model predictions.
Once you have created and trained your model you’re going to want to be able to interact with it. While it’s possible to do this manually in a jupyter notebook, you will most likely want to automate your predictions.
I’ve created a dashboard using React.js which enables a user to configure the features of a game, which we can then send to an API in order to receive a prediction.
